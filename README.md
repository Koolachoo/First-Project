This is a comprehensive music searching tool used to find a live event based off of a song title, artist, or album.
After inserting the search criteria, the tool displays a list of results that pertain to the search, with song title, album, album art, and artist in a set of boxes.
The boxes are a clickable button.
If the pertaining artist has an event in the near future, the button will lead to a list of upcoming events.
When the event is clicked, it leads to a site to purchase tickets.
